### types:
- feat: new feature
- docs: documentation
- fix : bug fixed
- refactor: refactoring (changing code without affecting functionnality)
- style: minor refactoring, for code style only (eg. changed variable name, use objects instead of dicts...)
- dep: dependencies add/remove dependencides
- conf: changing config files
- ui: fixing typos or improving CLI/GUI
- log: add/remove logging
- struct: structural/organizational changes, not big enough to be considered a refactoring.
- prep: Addition of classes/methods/functions/stuff in anticipation for future features
- misc: this should eventually go away, it stays while I define other types I need.
