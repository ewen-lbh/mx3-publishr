# Todo
Minor features/Q-O-L Improvements that aren't part of the main objectives
- [x] Instead of a log 'sepator', use a log 'wapper', so that you can make stuff like `[!]` instead of `!|`
- [x] Colored CLI
- [ ] Move watermark out of consts.py
- [x] use pyfiglet instead of harcoded logos for watermark
- [ ] auto-detect # TODO lines and bring them here
