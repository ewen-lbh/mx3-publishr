# Todo
Minor features/Q-O-L Improvements that aren't part of the main objectives
- Instead of a log 'sepator', use a log 'wapper', so that you can make stuff like '\[!\]' instead of '!|'
- Colored CLI
- Move watermark out of consts.py
- use pyfiglet instead of harcoded logos for watermark
- auto-detect # TODO lines and bring them here
